# Project30 

## Motivation
This project was created to output the services of a company that offers boat rides in the Jo達o Pessoa-PB, Brazil.

## Content

1. Home Page

    The idea developed on the homepage was to tell the visitor a little about the city to develop some curiosity and interest while displaying the city and output some of the most beautiful points of Jo達o Pessoa. To sell our product we have to first convince the customer to visit our city. This page contains a carousel and a mini-map embedded.

2. Contact Page

    The contact page broadcasted the company contacts and address, with the idea to provide more support information if necessary. This page contains small icons for better and faster understanding and a mini-map embedded.

3. About us Page

    This page came to fill the missing spot of content, since that in the project we had information about the city and the tours provided, but not about the company. With this, the idea is to bring the customer closer to know and trust us before sealing anything.

4. Services Page

    This page comes to broadcast the most famous destinations in Jo達o Pessoa. Each of these pages will provide the visitor information about the place, location and some pictures to develop their interest.

    - Areia Vermelha
    - Pic達ozinho
    - Seixas
    - Sunset

5. Rent Page

    The idea of this page was to output our equipment. Show the clients the variety of boats that we have to offer them, with different sizes and specifications to not only sell the tours talked previously, but also receive their event if they want, birthday parties, marriages and other private events.

6. Sign Up & Login Page

    This page comes to get the client information after all the information displayed.
